# Dual Command Mode
Dual Command Mode is a mod for Homeworld Remastered 2.1 which allows you to control 2 fleets at once in a multiplayer/skirmish match to make up for an odd number of players or if you just want a challenge.

## Description
In multiplayer you'll often end up with an odd number of players which means you either need to add AI, fight in uneven teams or FFA all of which are not always optimal. 
Dual Command Mode allows one player to control two players worth of units. You will start with two motherships, 2 carriers, double the usual starting RUs and your unit caps are also double what they usually are. Research cost is also doubled to ensure you pay the full price for two players worth of units.

## New deathmatch options
- Enable/Disable Minelayers
- Enable/Disable Platforms
- Enable/Disable Dual Command Mode
- Observer/Spectator Race

## To Enable Dual Command
- Change your race to a 2X version of the race
- Add a CPU and put it in the slot you would like to have as your second main
- Set the CPUs race to the same race as you (must be 2X)
- Enable the Dual Command option
- Set the Dual Command Player Slot to the slot of the player who will dual command
- Set the Dual Command Slave Slot to the slot of the CPU you just added

## Notes
- The CPU's units will be given to you at the start of the game so make sure it is the same race as you (must be 2X)
If they are not the same race you will not be able to build from their production
