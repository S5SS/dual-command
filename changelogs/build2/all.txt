[h1]BUILD 2[/h1]

Fighters:
- hw2 int damage vs collectors 0.33 -> 0.363 (build 1) -> 0.4 (build 2) (ints were absolute trash in 2.3, no point in winning int superiority)
  hw1 ints do more damage to colls than hw2 already

Corvettes:
- vaygr laser vett 650 -> 625 ru

Frigates:
- capture immobilize percentage 50% -> 20% (no one bothers with capturing because all you need to do is hyper away, this is to nerf anti marine)

Captials:
- hw2 mothership build speed 1000 -> 1500 ru (+50%)
- hw2 carrier build speed 1500 -> 2250 ru (+50%)
- hw2 shipyard build speed 1000 -> 1750 ru (+75%)
- hiig shipyard build speed upgrade 40 -> 60 secs (vaygr sy is 95 also the hiig ms build speed takes 60 secs, makes no sense that its shorter)

- vaygr cap ship speed res 2000 -> 1750 ru
- hiig bc armor 1500 -> 2000 ru (makes no sense that its the same as for dd)
- hiig bc speed 600 -> 900 ru
- hiig mothership hp 30 -> 45 secs (its a get out of jail free card)
- destroyer cap 6 -> 5 (6 destroyer deathball is lame to fight, destroyers got a huge buff already)

Other:
- fixed 2x races from appearing in random races
