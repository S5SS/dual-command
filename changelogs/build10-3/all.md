# All Races
> *This build is mainly a bug fix update to fix some long standing bugs with the game.*

## Taiidan Ion Cannon Frigates
> *Taiidan Ion Cannon Frigate cost was 700 RU whereas for Kushan it was 750 RU - this has been fixed.*
* **Taiidan Ion Cannon Frigate cost** *700 RU => 750 RU*

## Kushan Gravwells
> *Kushan Gravwells only lasted for 25s whereas Taiidan lasted for 30s - this has been fixed.*
* **Kushan Gravwell duration** *25s => 30s*

## Capture Frigates
> *Capture frigates were very easy to counter due to a bug from 2.1 which allowed boarding to be
   canceled at no cost by attempting to hyperspace inside an inhibitor.*
* **Hyperspace is disabled for all enemy units within gravity wells** (You could not hyperspace before either but the ship would try to, now it cannot even attempt)

## Hiigaran Carrier Inhibitor
> *The inhibitor radius was 10800 instead of 10500 like all other inhibitors.*
* **Inhibitor range made the same as all other inhibitors** *10800 => 10500*

## Observer Race
> *Observers tended to interfere with games when alive but could not talk while dead.*
* **Observers are hyperspaced off of the map where they cannot interfere with the game**
* **Observer sensor range reduced to 0 so they cannot give any vision**
* **Observers can now see the whole map without scuttling which means they can still talk**
* **Observers automatically surrender if there is only one team left so AFK players cannot stall the game**
