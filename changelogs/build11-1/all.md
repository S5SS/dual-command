# All Races

## Hot-Fixes
* **Assault craft damage to HW2 fighters reverted to pre-build 8 amount** (It was balanced before hand - it did not need changing.)
* **Fixed build times not showing for certain modules and units.**

## Misc
* **Hiigaran advanced research module build time** `150s => 140s`
* **Hiigaran advanced research module icon changed** (It is slightly different to the normal research module but its almost un-noticeable.)
* **Hiigaran battlecruiser research time** `140s => 150s` (To make up for the shorter advanced research module build time.)
* **HW1 scout speed boost amount** `+25% => +10%` (They are almost impossible to catch because of speed boost.)
