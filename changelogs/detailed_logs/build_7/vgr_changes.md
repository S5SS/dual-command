# Vaygr

## Corvette Facility
> *Vaygr corvettes are top of the food chain and have been for a while. Vaygr players will naturally have more production than their opponents due to cheap carriers and early production improvements. A small logistical hit to corvettes should temper their viability.*
* **Build cost up:** `725 => 850`
* **Build time up:** `60 => 65`

## Corvettes (missiles, lasers)
> *Unupgraded corvettes are dropping like flies - upgraded corvettes are almost unkillable (especially if you get bad accuracy rolls) with a close dock. These changes normalise vette performance, although its undoubtedly a nerf overall.*
* **Base health up:** 
  * **(missiles, lasers)**: `unit: 480 => 510` so `squad: 1920 => 2040`
  * **(command)**: `900 => 1080`
* **Health upgrade multiplier down:** `1.5x => 1.25x` therefore upgraded health is now:
  * **(missiles, lasers)** `unit: 720 => 638` so `squad: 2880 => 2550`
  * **(command):** `1350 => 1350` no change

## Scouts
> *Scouts currently provide totally free and nigh-undeniable vison for the user if waypointed in a double-passive circle. Even in a freak accident where your opponent is able to snipe a scout squad, they're easily replaced. Vision is a resource to be fought for.*
* **Base max movespeed down:** `420 => 353` therefore upgraded speed is now `588 => 490`
* **No longer get a max speed boost from evasive tactics:** `1.1 => 1.0`
* **Primary sensor radius down (blue sphere in manager):** `9000 => 7000`
* **Secondary sensor radius down (works the same, but invisible):** `11000 => 8500` 11000 is almost as high as a probe (`12000`) - way too high.
