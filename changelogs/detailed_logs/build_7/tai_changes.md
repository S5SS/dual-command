## Defenders
> *Research cost is way too high for a unit primarily designed to hold or bolster rush tactics. Defenders have very little other practical use, they don't need pushing further into obscurity.*
* **Research cost down:** `1000 => 650`
* **Research time down:** `75 => 60`
* **Projectile speed waaaay up:** `1200 => 1800` Slower than ints (`1900`) but faster than multiguns (`1700`)

---

## Heavy Cruisers
> *The idea of HC being a real threat in combination with support frigates is definitely valid; however making the unit cost so much its a completely unviable option (aka removing it from the game) is really not a great solution.*
* **Research cost down:** `6000 => 5000`

---

## Ion Cannon Frigates
> *HW1 ions currently rock the competition, especially when paired with repairers (rep vettes get a bonus here since they are very resilient to the type of units ion cannons are built to fight such as other ions)*
* **Build cost up:** `700 => 750`

---

## Scouts
> *Scouts currently provide totally free and nigh-undeniable vison for the user if waypointed in a double-passive circle. Even in a freak accident where your opponent is able to snipe a scout squad, they're easily replaced. Vision is a resource to be fought for.*
* **No longer get a max speed boost from evasive tactics:** `1.1 => 1.0`
* **Primary sensor radius down (blue sphere in manager):** `8000 => 7000`
* **Secondary sensor radius down (works the same, but invisible):** `10000 => 8500`

## Support Frigates
> *Worth a little too much; a little too good, a little too cheap*
* **Build cost up:** `600 => 700`
