# Vaygr

## Race changes
> *Hiigaran and Vaygr inhibs are getting a small radius reduction. Hyperspace is far too rare to see outside of hypertorp or all-ins. This is partly due to pricing, but its also because hs inhibs are **gigantic**. On medium maps such as Fallen Lords, a single inhib can cover the entire front side of your base. Slightly smaller inhibs allow for more aggressive backstabs with hyperspacing capitals etc.*
* **HS inhib radius down:** `12000 => 10500`
  * `vgr_mothership.ship`
  * `vgr_carrier.ship`
  * `vgr_battlecruiser.ship`
  * `vgr_shipyard.ship`

---

## Destroyers
> *See changes to Hiigaran scout EMP*
* **EMP shield HP down:** `1000 => 850` (takes 8 squads in a burst)

---

## Gun platforms
> *When was the last time gun platforms swung a game? In a skilled matchup, maybe not since HW2 classic. More changes are likely coming down the line, but for now some touch ups will do.*
* **Weapon changes:**
  * **Damage per shot up:** `40 => 60` // As interceptors have `110` HP, gun platforms now take two shots instead of three to score a kill.
  * **Accuracy vs hw1 fighters up:** `0.85 => 0.95`

---

## Hyperspace platforms
> *This unit really stinks huh? If only they could penetrate through inhibs. Barring that, reducing the cost of something which has a barely superior effect to simply moving your production ships is another avenue.*
* **Max speed up:** `600 => 800`
* **Link formation cost down:** `1000 => 750`

## Infiltrator frigates
> *This unit, while superior to marines in many ways, is also inferior in others - mainly the timing which it hits the field. In order to have an upgrade infiltrator on the map, several logistical hurdles have to be overcome, meaning they rarely make an appearance until a time where the map is swarming with units excellent at killing them. Some small touch ups.*
* **Base HP up:** `20000 => 21000` (Upgraded: `28000 => 29400`)
* **Base max speed up:** `230 => 240` (Upgraded: `288 => 300`)
* **Base max strafe speed up:** `230 => 240` (Upgraded: `288 => 300`)
* **Max rotation speed up:** `22 => 35`
* **Strafe acceleration time down:** `7 => 6`
* **Forward acceleration time down:** `8 => 5`
