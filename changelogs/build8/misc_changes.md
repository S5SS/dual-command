## Field multiplier cap changes
> *Fire control has been nerfed through the floor. Although such a bonus for no micro investment is usually bad, this nerf was a little too far. For reference, these caps were `1.4` in classic. For benchmarks, Hiigaran gain `1.07x` for each fire control: they need four fields to max out at `1.07 ^ 4 = 1.31` (capped down to `1.3`. Vaygr get `1.10x` multipliers, so they only need three fields: `1.10 ^ 3 = 1.33` (capped down to `1.3`).*
* **Weapon accuracy bonus cap:** `1.2 => 1.3`
* **Weapon damage bonus cap:** `1.2 => 1.3`
