## Destroyers
> *See changes to Hiigaran scout EMP*
* **EMP shield HP down:** `1000 => 850` (takes 8 squads in a burst)

---

## Minelayers
> *This unit was essentially removed from competetive play to prevent abusers from forming huge mine curtains and stalling the game out indefinitely. This is a shame, because minelayers are actually a very interesting unit with a lot of rewarding micro gameplay for both the user and defender during both staged fights and backstabs. Bringing this unit back into play but cutting away its undesirable qualities is the goal here.*
* **Max strafe speed up:** `255 => 280`
* **Max speed up:** `255 => 280`
* **Cost down:** `400 => 375`
* **Build time down:** `45 => 30`
* **Weapon (mine) changes:** (*`kus_mine.miss`*)
  * **Lifetime down:** `200s => 60s` // Minelayers are able keep about 8 mines active (compared to perhaps 20 previously)

## Missile Destroyers
> *Fix to an error in 7.0, the speed of the missiles is now actually changed.*
* **Burst fire missile speed fixed:** `425 => 850`
* **EMP shield down:** `1000 => 700` // See changes to Hiigaran scout EMP

## Resource Collectors
> *Jumping targeted collectors is working as a get-out-of-jail-free card. The cost of a collector jump should possibly be even greater, but a smaller change for now*
* **Minimum HS jump cost up:** `300 => 450`
