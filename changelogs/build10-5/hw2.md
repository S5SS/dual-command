# Homeworld 2 Races

## Hyperspace Gateway
> *Hyperspace gateways are too inconvenient to be worth the cost - they are almost never built in competitive games and for good reason.*
* **Gateway health** *18750 => 28125* (It is killed far too easily for its cost especially without the armor upgrade.)
* **Gateway link cost** *750 RU => 250 RU* (Its possible to change the gateway a gateway is linked to but its not worth it in most cases considering the cost.)
* **Gateway vision range** *1000 => 4000* (This is the minimum range the unit can see - e.g any unit, even ones in a dust cloud, will be visible at this range.)
* **Gateway sensor range** *4000 => 7500* (This is the maximum range the unit can see.)
* **Gateway heal time** *1200s => 600s*
* **Gateway nebula damage** *40s => 120s* (This is the time it takes to die in a nebula.)
* **All probes can now travel through a gateway** (Platforms are able to travel through a gateway even though they are single shot units.)

## Minelayers
> *Homeworld 2 minelayers are too inconvenient.*
* **Mine lifetime** `200s => 60s` (About 8 mines at a time can be layed.)
* **Vaygr minelayer health** `900 => 1200`
* **Hiigaran minelayer health** `900 => 1620`
* **Vaygr minelayer speed** `233 => 231`
* **Hiigaan minelayer speed** `233 => 291`

## Command Corvette
> *This unit is outclassed in almost every way by a fire control tower.*
* **Command corvettes can now kamikaze**
* **Command corvette cost** `400 RU => 750 RU`
* **Command corvette speed** `230 => 231` (This is so they have the same move speed as other corvettes.)
* **Command corvette health** `900 => 1275`
* **Command corvette area of effect** `2200 => 3000`
