# Kushan

## Race changes
> *Playing against a skilled HW1 player on a small (or even a medium) map was mostly guesswork due to hangar sizes combined with the lack of modules. This change is a little against the sprit of classic, but is certainly healthy for remastered multiplayer.*
* **Production ships now display modules if that technology has been researched**
  * `kus_mothership.ship`
  * `kus_carrier.ship`

## Cloaked Fighters
>*Still a never-seen unit (for the wrong reasons). Kushan struggles to justify its existence in multiplayer games and has no real advantage over taii field technology.*
* **Out-of-combat regen added:** `0.75 HP/s` // Regenerates from 0 to max in 3 minutes. Being 'out-of-combat' takes 5 seconds of no damage taken.
  *  **Glow effect added to regenerating fighters**
* **Research cost down:** `1000 => 825`
* **Research time down:** `80 => 70`
* **Build cost down:** `120 => 110`
* **Build time down:** `12 => 10`
