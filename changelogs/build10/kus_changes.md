# Kushan

## Race changes
> *Playing against a skilled HW1 player on a small (or even a medium) map was mostly guesswork due to hangar sizes combined with the lack of modules. This change is a little against the sprit of classic, but is certainly healthy for remastered multiplayer.*
* **Production ships now display modules if that technology has been researched**
  * `kus_mothership.ship`
  * `kus_carrier.ship`

## Missile Destroyer
> *A little overtuned. Perhaps this ability will be revisited again soon - right now its made the MDD into an all-killing monster of a unit.*
* **Missile burst ability damage down:**
  * **multiplier vs frigates:** `5.0 => 3.0`
  * **multiplier vs capitals:** `7.0 => 6.0`
