## Build Menu
> *Further tweaks to the build menu*
* **Changed the color of the amount of units queued in build menu back to white**
* **Set build and research times to show by default**

## Private Messages
> *Private messages make a sound even when you are not the recipient*
* **PM sound is now muted - PM's are noticeable enough without the sound**

## Interceptors
> *Interceptor damage to subsystems meant mass ints could easily kill subsystems while taking minimal losses*
* **Interceptor penetration to subsystems reverted back to the 2.1 amount** `1.4 => 1.0`

## Friendly Fire
> *Friendly fire from bombers and other units can hit squad members, potentially killing them*
* **Friendly fire reduced back to 2.1 amount** `100% => 50%`

## Dual Command
> *Dual command is currently fiddly to setup and easy to make a mistake with so these changes aim to make things simpler*
* **Removed option to enable/disable dual command along with the master and slave selectors**
* **To use dual command simply give a human player a 2X race and an AI player a 2X race - the AI will automatically become the slave**
* **Note however that you can still only have one dual commander per match**
