## Race changes
> *Playing against a skilled HW1 player on a small (or even a medium) map was mostly guesswork due to hangar sizes combined with the lack of modules. This change is a little against the sprit of classic, but is certainly healthy for remastered multiplayer.*
* **Production ships now display modules if that technology has been researched:**
  * `tai_mothership.ship`
  * `tai_carrier.ship`
