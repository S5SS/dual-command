## Tactical Icons
> *Certain units are very important to quickly identify, some of these units have been given new, yet still in the spirit of Homeworld, tactical icons.*
* **Proximity Sensors:** `Probe icon => Upside down probe icon`
* **Sensor Distortion Probes:** `Probe icon => Tall rectangle icon`
* **Missile Destroyers:** `Destroyer icon => Mirrored destroyer icon`
* **Gravity Well Generators:** `Frigate icon => Circle icon`

## Build and Research Times
> *Currently you have no way to know how long a unit or piece of research will take to complete.*
* **Build and research times have been added to the build and research menus.**
* **This option is off by default, to turn it on change the option in the gameplay settings tab.**

## Tweaked Score Totals
> *The combat total is calculated as such: `ShipbuiltRU + ShipsCapturedRU + ShipsDestroyedRU - ShipslostRU` which is how you can get a good combat score without doing any combat.*
* **Combat total:** `ShipbuiltRU + ShipsCapturedRU + ShipsDestroyedRU - ShipslostRU => ShipsCapturedRU + ShipsDestroyedRU`
* **Building and research total:** `ShipbuiltRU + 1.5 * SubsystemsRU + ResearchRU => ShipbuiltRU + 1.0 * SubsystemsRU + ResearchRU`

## New Tactical Overlay Setting
> *There are even more verbose settings for the tactical overlay that are not normally accessible.*
* **Added 4th tactical overlay setting which shows the maximum amount of information**
* **Added setting under the gameplay tab to set the default tactical overlay setting on startup**
