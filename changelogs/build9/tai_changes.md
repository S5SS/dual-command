## Interceptors
> *Anti-fighter units are now performing a lot better, meaning players now have real options against int clouds. This has dropped interceptors down a few tiers, so good play using fighters needs rewarding properly again.*
* **Damage multiplier vs collectors up:** `0.55 => 0.6`
* **Accuracy vs collectors up:** `0.8 => 1.0`

## Salvage Corvettes Missing Kamikaze
> *Salvage corvettes mysteriously seem to not have the ability to kamikaze despite all other fighters and corvettes being able to.*
* **Salvage corvettes can now kamikaze**
