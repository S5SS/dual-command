## Interceptors
> *Anti-fighter units are now performing a lot better, meaning players now have real options against int clouds. This has dropped interceptors down a few tiers, so good play using fighters needs rewarding properly again.*
* **Damage multiplier vs collectors up:** `0.4 => 0.5`
* **Accuracy vs collectors up:** `0.8 => 1.0`

## Collector Repair Research
> *The research cost and time is a barrier that prevents more people using HW2 collector repair.*
* **Cost** `500 RU => 200 RU`
* **Time** `35s => 20s`
