## Hyperspace Gateway
> *Hyperspace gateways are too inconvenient to be worth the cost - they are almost never built in competitive games and for good reason.*
* **Health increased** *18750 => 37000* (It is killed far too easily for its cost especially without the armor upgrade)
* **Gateway link cost decreased** *750 => 250* (Its possible to change the gateway a gateway is linked to but its not worth it in most cases considering the cost)
* **Vision range increased** *1000 => 4000* (This is the minimum range the unit can see - e.g any unit, even ones in a dust cloud, will be visible at this range)
* **Sensor range increased** *4000 => 7500* (This is the maximum range the unit can see)
* **Heal time reduced** *1200s => 600s*
* **Nebula damage reduced** *40s => 120s* (This is the time it takes to die in a nebula)
* **All probes can now travel through a gateway** (Platforms are able to travel through a gateway so just because most probes are single shot doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to)
