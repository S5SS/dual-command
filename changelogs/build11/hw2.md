# Homeworld 2 Races

## Vaygr Destroyer
> *The missiles take a long time to hit their target so are easy for collectors to run from unlike the Hiigaran destroyer*
* **Missile travel speed** `228 => 320`
* **Research cost** `2000 RU => 1750 RU` (To counteract the more expensive capital ship facility.)

## Vaygr Capitals
> *Vaygr usually uses HMF because going capitals costs a huge amount for them. These changes are designed to both
   make getting fast carriers more expensive and to make destroyers more viable in 1v1s.*
* **Build cost** `1250 RU => 1500 RU` (To bring the cost closer to Hiigaran.)
* **Health upgrade cost** `3500 RU => 3000 RU`
* **Health upgrade time** `95s => 90s`
* **Speed upgrade cost** `1750 RU => 1500 RU`
* **Speed upgrade time** `80s => 70s`
* **Battlecruiser research cost** `2500 RU => 3000 RU` (The cost of upgrades have been redistributed onto battlecruisers.)
* **Shipyard cost** `4000 RU => 3750 RU` (To counteract the increased capital ship facility cost.)

## Carrier Improved Manufacturing
> *Hiigaran carrier improved manufacturing is arguably less useful than Vaygr improved manufacturing since Vaygr tends to have more carriers.*
* **Hiigaran carrier improved manufacturing cost** `2250 RU => 2000 RU`
* **Vaygr carrier improved manufacturing cost** `2250 RU => 2500 RU`
