## Missile Destroyer
> *This unit is arguably the best in the game now due to it being good vs frigates and godly vs swarm*
* **Auto-attack range** `3900 => 3750`
* **Auto-attack damage to fighters** `65 => 39` (Now takes one shot extra to kill most fighters)
* **Auto-attack damage to fighters** `-20%` (Sounds like a lot but it's less than it sounds due to the missiles that don't hit their target having a higher chance of expiring before impact)
* **Volley damage to frigates* `-16.6%`
