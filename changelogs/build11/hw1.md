# Homeworld 1 Races

## Missile Destroyer
> *This unit is arguably the best in the game now due to it being good vs frigates and godly vs swarm*
* **Auto-attack range** `3900 => 3750` (Its too easy for it to safely attack swarm from behind the front line)
* **Auto-attack damage to fighters** `75 => 39` (Now takes one shot extra to kill most fighters)
* **Auto-attack damage to corvettes** `-20%` (Sounds like a lot but it's less than it sounds due to the missiles that don't hit their target having a higher chance of expiring before impact)
* **Volley damage to frigates* `-33%` (Its very good at sniping damaged frigates which reduces the reward for skilled frigate retreat micro)
