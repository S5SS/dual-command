# All Races
> *This is a hotfix patch to fix some of the more frustrating things about the game and for tournament balance.*

## Misc
* **Capital kamikaze multiplier** `0.25 => 0.16` (Upgraded collectors to kill an unupgraded carrier: (Vay) 5 => 8 (Hiig) 7 => 9 (HW1) 9 => 14)
* **HW1 collector health** `5000 => 4000` (Both to reduce kamikaze damage and to make HW1 easier to rush.)
* **Heavy missile frigate base health** `18500 => 18000`
* **HW1 interceptor health** `110 => 100`
* **HW1 fighter drive research cost** `200 RU => 250 RU`
* **HW1 fighter drive research time** `20s => 25s`
* **HW1 fighter chassis research cost** `500 RU => 650 RU`
* **HW1 fighter chassis research time** `25s => 30s`
* **HW1 corvette drive research cost** `1000 RU => 1200 RU`
* **Taiidan defender research cost** `1000 RU => 650 RU` (Kushan research was 650 RU so this is to fixe this bug.)
* **HW1 scout build cost** `70 RU => 150 RU`
* **HW1 scout build time** `7s => 10s`
* **HW1 scout move speed** `485 => 465` (With speed boost they are almost unkillable when micro managed.)
* **HW1 scout visual range** `1500 => 3000` (To make them better at finding probes in dust clouds.)
* **HW1 scout primary sensor range** `8500 => 7500`
* **HW1 scout secondary sensor range** `7000 => 6000`
* **HW2 scout visual range** `1500 => 4000` (To make them better at finding probes in dust clouds.)
* **HW1 scout visual range** `1500 => 3000` (To make them better at finding probes in dust clouds.)
* **HW1 scout primary sensor range** `8500 => 7500`
* **HW1 scout secondary sensor range** `7000 => 6000`
* **HW2 scout visual range** `1500 => 4000` (To make them better at finding probes in dust clouds.)
* **Gravwell cost** `800 RU => 1000 RU`

## Missile Destroyer
> *This unit is arguably the best in the game now due to it being good vs frigates and godly vs swarm.*
* **Auto-attack range** `3900 => 3750` (Its too easy for it to safely attack swarm from behind the front line.)
* **Auto-attack damage to fighters** `75 => 39` (Now takes one shot extra to kill most fighters.)
* **Auto-attack damage to corvettes** `-20%` (Sounds like a lot but it's less than it sounds due to the missiles that don't hit their target having a higher chance of expiring before impact.)
* **Volley damage to frigates* `-33%` (Its very good at sniping damaged frigates which reduces the reward for skilled frigate retreat micro.)
* **Volley damage to capitals* `-50%` (A MDD will die in 3 volleys i.e. TTK with 1 MDD vs 2 MDD is ~50-60s which is high for an anti-swarm unit.)

## Battlecruisers
> *Battlecruisers are arguably the most important unit in large 3v3 games yet slow the game down and are very difficult to
   beat when faced with a large number without your own battlecruisers.*
* **HW1 battlecruiser health** `240000 => 200000`
* **HW2 battlecruiser health** `268800 => 224000` (Upgraded health.)
* **HW1 battlecruiser speed** `115 => 120`
* **HW2 battlecruiser speed** `99 => 109` (Upgraded speed.)
* **Vaygr battlecruiser missile speed** `228 => 320`
* **Battlecruiser side and top armor** `1.0 => 1.2` (This means battlecruisers will take more damage from the top, bottom and sides.)
* **Battlecruiser range** `-10%`
