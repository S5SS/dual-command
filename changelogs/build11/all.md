# All Races
> *This is a hotfix patch to fix some of the more frustrating things about the game and for tournament balance.*

## Hotfixes
* **Capital kamikaze multiplier** `0.25 => 0.16` (Upgraded collectors to kill an unupgraded carrier: (Vay) 5 => 8 (Hiig) 7 => 9 (HW1) 9 => 14)
* **HW1 collector health** `5000 => 4000` (Both to reduce kamikaze damage and to make HW1 easier to rush.)
