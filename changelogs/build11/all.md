# All Races

## Point Defense
> *Defenders advantage is already quite high and point defense makes it tough to push an enemy with ints/bombers.*
* **Mothership/Flagship point defense damage** `-40%`
* **Mobile refineries PD damage** `-66%`

## Refineries and Resource Controllers
> *Mobile refineries and resource controllers are quite tanky making them tricky to kill with sneak attacks.*
* **Mobile refinery health** `18000 => 16000`
* **Resource controller health** `30000 => 27500`

## Healing
> *Healing slows units down a substantial amount.*
* **Speed reduction under healing** `65% => 95%` (Meaning units will only be 5% slower when being healed)

## Hyperspace
> *There *
* **Hyperspace distance cost halved** (This does not make hyperspace twice as cheap - the distance you must hyperspace to reach the min/max cost is just higher)
* **HW2 carrier hyperspace min cost reduced to same as HW2**
* **Vaygr Flagship hyperspace cost is now the same as Hiigaran to make destroyer rush more viable.**
