# All Races

## Point Defense
> *Defenders advantage is already quite high and point defense makes it tough to push an enemy with ints/bombers.*
* **HW1 and HW2 Mothership/Flagship point defense damage** `-40%`
* **Mobile refinery point defense damage** `-66%`

## Refineries, Resource Controllers and Collectors
> *Mobile refineries and resource controllers are quite tanky making them tricky to kill with sneak attacks.*
* **Mobile refinery health** `18000 => 16000`
* **Resource controller health** `30000 => 27500`
* **Hiigaran mobile refinery build time** `45s => 40s` (This is so they match Vaygr.)
* **Hiigaran resource collector health upgrade** `800 RU => 1000 RU` (For just 800 RU its a no-brainer upgrade.)
* **Hiigaran mobile refinery health upgrade** `400 RU => 500 RU` (Same as above.)
* **HW1 resource collector health** `5000 => 4000` (To match HW2 - currently HW1 is essentially unrushable due to tanky collectors and no modules.)
* **HW1 resource collector kamikaze damage** `+25%` (Less health means less kamikaze damage therefore this balances it out again.)

## Healing
> *Healing slows units down a substantial amount.*
* **Speed reduction under healing** `65% => 95%` (Meaning units will only be 5% slower when being healed.)

## Hyperspace
> *One of the defining aspects of HW is ironically rarely used in competitive games.*
* **Hyperspace distance cost halved** (This does not make hyperspace twice as cheap - the distance you must hyperspace to reach the min/max cost is just higher.)
* **HW2 carrier minimum hyperspace cost reduced to same as HW2**
* **Vaygr Flagship hyperspace cost is now the same as Hiigaran to make destroyer rush more viable.**
* **Vaygr hyperspace gate research cost** `750 RU => 500 RU` (To make double DD and other hyper strats more viable.)
* **Vaygr hyperspace gate research time** `50s => 45s` (Same as above.)

## Destroyers
> *Destroyers feel a bit clumsy and there isn't much point in rushing them over frigates.*
* **Vaygr destroyer missile travel speed** `228 => 320` (So that the missiles can catch a collector.)
* **Vaygr destroyer research cost** `2000 RU => 1750 RU` (To counteract the more expensive capital ship facility.)
* **HW1 destroyer turn speed** `9 => 15`
* **HW2 destroyer turn speed** `9 => 18` (This is much needed because of how HW2 destroyers need to face their bow to the enemy.)
* **Destroyer acceleration time** `6s => 3s`
* **Destroyer turn acceleration time* `0.5s => 0.4s`
* **Destroyer turn brake time* `0.3s => 0.2s`
* **Destroyer damage to capitals** `+25%` (They take a very long time to kill carriers and each other.)

## Missile Destroyer
> *This unit is arguably the best in the game now due to it being good vs frigates and godly vs swarm.*
* **Auto-attack range** `3900 => 3750` (Its too easy for it to safely attack swarm from behind the front line.)
* **Auto-attack damage to fighters** `75 => 39` (Now takes one shot extra to kill most fighters.)
* **Auto-attack damage to corvettes** `-20%` (Sounds like a lot but it's less than it sounds due to the missiles that don't hit their target having a higher chance of expiring before impact.)
* **Volley damage to frigates* `-33%` (Its very good at sniping damaged frigates which reduces the reward for skilled frigate retreat micro.)
* **Volley damage to capitals* `-50%` (A MDD will die in 3 volleys i.e. TTK with 1 MDD vs 2 MDD is ~50-60s which is high for an anti-swarm unit.)

## Battlecruisers
> *Battlecruisers are arguably the most important unit in large 3v3 games yet slow the game down and are very difficult to
   beat when faced with a large number without your own battlecruisers.*
* **HW1 battlecruiser health** `240000 => 200000`
* **HW2 battlecruiser health** `268800 => 192000` (Upgraded health.)
* **HW1 battlecruiser speed** `115 => 120`
* **HW2 battlecruiser speed** `99 => 109` (Upgraded speed.)
* **Vaygr battlecruiser missile speed** `228 => 320`
* **Battlecruiser side and top armor** `1.0 => 1.2` (This means battlecruisers will take more damage from the top, bottom and sides.)
* **Battlecruiser range** `-10%`

## Vaygr Capitals
> *Vaygr usually uses HMF because going capitals costs a huge amount for them. These changes are designed to both
   make getting fast carriers more expensive and to make destroyers more viable in 1v1s.*
* **Build cost** `1250 RU => 1500 RU` (To bring the cost closer to Hiigarans.)
* **Health upgrade cost** `3500 RU => 3000 RU`
* **Health upgrade time** `95s => 90s`
* **Speed upgrade cost** `1750 RU => 1500 RU`
* **Speed upgrade time** `80s => 70s`
* **Battlecruiser research cost** `2500 RU => 3000 RU` (The cost of upgrades have been redistributed onto battlecruisers.)
* **Shipyard build cost** `4000 RU => 3750 RU` (To counteract the increased capital ship facility cost.)
* **Shipyard build time** `85s => 80s` (To make double DD more viable.)

## Improved Manufacturing
> *Hiigaran carrier improved manufacturing is arguably less useful than Vaygr improved manufacturing since Vaygr tends to have more carriers - Vice versa for capitals.*
* **Hiigaran carrier improved manufacturing cost** `2250 RU => 2000 RU`
* **Vaygr carrier improved manufacturing cost** `2250 RU => 2500 RU`
* **Vaygr flagship improved manufacturing cost** `1500 RU => 1250 RU`
* **Vaygr shipyard improved manufacturing cost** `1750 RU => 1500 RU`
