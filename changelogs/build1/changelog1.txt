[h1]BUILD 1[/h1]

Fighter:
- hw1 + hiig ints do 20% more damage to vetts
- vaygr ints do + 10% damage to vetts (less because they have lance)
- vaygr lance speed increased to slightly less than int speed
- vaygr lance damage +28% (lance now actually beat miss vetts in equal numbers and significantly beat them in equal rus)
- all ints damage to collectors +10%

Corvettes:
- vaygr command vett and laser vett research time 60 -> 45 secs (doesnt make sense they take more time than assault frigates)
- hiig pulsar -20% accuracy vs fighters
- minelayers are now non military units (to make military selection easier)

Frigates:
- hiig defense field frigate 1250 -> 1000 ru 70 -> 60 secs
- hiig defense field frigate move speed 177 -> 230 (same as marine frigate)

Capitals:
- hw1 bc res 9000 -> 7500 ru
- hw1 missile destroyer hp -25% (they were squishy in the first place to make up for their insane swarm dps)
- vaygr cap ship armor cost 4000 -> 3500 ru (much more than it is for hiig especially if you only want destroyers)

Platforms:
- vaygr platform production facility 625 -> 600 ru
- vaygr hyperspace platform 375 -> 325 ru

Utility:
- all proximity sensor res cost 500 -> 600 ru 35/40 -> 45 secs (to make anti cloak same cost as cloak and harder to get)
- hiig hyperspace sensors 250 -> 500 ru 35 -> 45 secs (too cheap for how massively it helps against things like angle dd/bc)
- vaygr hyperspace sensors 250 -> 750 ru 35 secs -> 45 secs (hiig gets better sensors)
- hiig anti cloak sensors 250 -> 375 ru 35 -> 45 secs (ruins alot of nice cloak strats with how easy it is to get)
- hiig collector repair 750 -> 500 ru 40 -> 35 secs (It already costs enough to move collectors away from mining)
- vaygr collector repair 500 -> 250 ru 30 -> 25 secs (cheaper because the vaygr collector armor upgrade costs more)

Other:
- friendly fire damage: 50% -> 100%
- kamikaze damage multiplier 100% -> 170% (kamikaze is still very inefficient but might actually be a viable strat in certain situations)
										  (12 missile vetts will kill an unupgraded vaygr carrier - its still very inefficient but you can actually kill stuff now)
