[h1]BUILD 5[/h1]

Fighters:
- hw1 scout 8 -> 7 secs (hw1 ints take the same time)

Corvettes:
- hw1 salvage vett res 1200 -> 500 ru 60 -> 30 secs
- hw1 heavy vett res 600 -> 800 ru 30 -> 50 secs
- hw1 multi-gun vett res 800 -> 1000 40 -> 60 secs
- hw1 minelaying res 1200 -> 1500 ru (same as vaygr)
  (the above 4 changes are to redistribute the research cost of going for high tech vetts, almost noone gets vetts specifically for salvs)
  (for example to get heavies you had to spend 3300 ru 165 secs but now its 2800 ru 155 secs)
- hw1 minelayers 275 -> 400 ru 35 -> 45 secs (now equal to hw2, hw1 also gets the best supporting units to minelayers ei gravs, mdd etc)
- hw1 light, heavy and multigun vetts -10 ru -1 sec

Frigates:
- kushan drone frigate 900 -> 800 ru 70 -> 60 secs (no reason for it to be that much, they cant even beat pulsars, barely beats bombers)
- hw1 ion frigates 800 -> 700 (hgn ion < hw1 ion < hmf)
- hw1 support frigate res 1300 -> 1000 ru 75 -> 60 secs (to make builds that skip ion frigs cheaper)
- hw1 ion res 2000 -> 2250 ru 120 -> 135 secs (to offset cheaper support frigates)

Capitals:
- hw1 carriers 165 -> 130 secs (vaygr takes 40 hiig takes 65, more than double the time of a hiig carrier is a bit much)
- hw1 carrier res 1700 -> 1500 ru
- hw1 mdd res 3500 -> 3000 ru
- hw1 dd res 5000 -> 4000 ru
- hw1 bc res 9000 -> 7500 (build 1) -> 7000 (build 5) ru (caps cost far too much as hw1)

Utility:
- hw1 cloak res 800 -> 500 ru 100 -> 50 secs (too inconvenient to get)

Other:
- fixed missing vaygr 2x research icons
- fixed a 2.1 bug where you could build 2 research ships at once if you only build them from carriers or only from motherships
- fixed the salvage capture scuttle bug
