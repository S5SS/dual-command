# All Races

## Point Defense
> *Defenders advantage is already quite high and point defense makes it tough to push an enemy with ints/bombers.*
* **HW1 and HW2 Mothership/Flagship point defense damage** `-40%`
* **Mobile refinery point defense damage** `-66%`

## Refineries, Resource Controllers and Collectors
> *Mobile refineries and resource controllers are quite tanky making them tricky to kill with sneak attacks.*
* **Mobile refinery health** `18000 => 16000`
* **Resource controller health** `30000 => 27500`
* **Hiigaran mobile refinery build time** `45s => 40s` (This is so they match Vaygr.)
* **Hiigaran resource collector health upgrade** `800 RU => 1000 RU` (For just 800 RU its a no-brainer upgrade.)
* **Hiigaran mobile refinery health upgrade** `400 RU => 500 RU` (Same as above.)

## Hyperspace
> *One of the defining aspects of HW is ironically rarely used in competitive games.*
* **Hyperspace distance cost halved** (This does not make hyperspace twice as cheap - the distance you must hyperspace to reach the min/max cost is just higher.)
* **HW2 carrier minimum hyperspace cost reduced to same as HW1**
* **Vaygr Flagship hyperspace cost is now the same as Hiigaran to make destroyer rush more viable.**
* **Vaygr hyperspace gate research cost** `750 RU => 500 RU` (To make double DD and other hyper strats more viable.)
* **Vaygr hyperspace gate research time** `50s => 45s` (Same as above.)

## HW1 Swarm
> *Interceptors and bombers are close to 2.1 in their current state. Scouts give vision too easily and are very spammable.
   Corvettes are far cheaper to research than for other races.*
* **HW1 bomber health** `135 => 125`
* **HW1 bomber build time** `10s => 11s`

## Bombers
> *Bomber being more relevant in the meta will cause more interesting sneak attack possibilities.*
* **Bomber max speed** `391 => 420`
* **Bomber projectile speed** `1200 => 1800` (Bombers can be easily countered by just moving a production ship.)

## Minelayers
> *Homeworld 2 minelayers are too inconvenient.*
* **Mine lifetime** `200s => 60s` (About 8 mines at a time can be layed.)
* **Vaygr minelayer health** `900 => 1200`
* **Hiigaran minelayer health** `900 => 1620`
* **Vaygr minelayer speed** `233 => 231`
* **Hiigaan minelayer speed** `233 => 291`

## Command Corvette
> *This unit is outclassed in almost every way by a fire control tower.*
* **Command corvettes can now kamikaze**
* **Command corvette cost** `400 RU => 750 RU`
* **Command corvette speed** `230 => 231` (This is so they have the same move speed as other corvettes.)
* **Command corvette health** `900 => 1275`
* **Command corvette area of effect** `2200 => 3000`

## Frigates
> *Anti-capital frigates dominate the 1v1 meta.*
* **HW2 anti-capital frigate build time** `45s => 50s`

## Flak Frigates
> *Flak frigates are not particularly useful currently due to fighters being more for anti-bomber/lance.*
* **Flak frigate armor research cost** `1000 RU => 500 RU`
* **Flak frigate armor research time** `75s => 40s`
* **Flak frigate speed research cost** `600 RU => 300 RU`
* **Flak frigate speed research time** `50s => 25s`
* **Flak frigate build time** *50s => 45s*

## Drone Frigates
> *Drone Frigates still aren't worth it.*
* **Drone Frigate cost** *700ru => 650ru*

## Probes
> *Probes give vision far too easily.*
* **Probe build cost** `100 RU => 120 RU`
* **Proximity sensor build time** `15s => 20s`
* **Probe visual range** `5000 => 2000`
* **Probe primary and secondary sensor range** `12000 => 10000`
* **HW2 proximity sensor speed** `600 => 500` (HW1 remains at 450.)
* **Probe speed** `600 => 500`

## ECM probes
> *ECM probes are somewhat useful in 3v3s but in 1v1s they aren't generally worth the cost.*
* **ECM probe visual range** `5000 => 4000`
* **ECM probe primary and secondary sensor range** `16000 => 14000`
* **Hiigaran ECM probe build cost** `600 RU => 500 RU` (To match Vaygr.)
* **Hiigaran ECM probe build time** `30s => 25s` (To match Vaygr.)
* **Hiigaran ECM probe research time** `45s => 30s`
* **Vaygr ECM probe research cost** `800 RU => 600 RU` (To match Hiigaran.)
* **Vaygr ECM probe research speed** `60s => 45s`
* **ECM probe speed** `600 => `1200` (For synergy with hyperspace gateways.)

## Hiigaran Sensor Modules
> *Hyperspace and cloak sensors shutdown many interesting strategies.*
* **Hiigaran hyperspace sensor cost** `500 RU => 750 RU` (To match Vaygr.)
* **Hiigaran cloak sensor cost** `375 RU => 450 RU` (To get a proximity sensor it costs 750 RU 65s vs 450 RU 45s for the cloak sensor.)

## Sensor Arrays
> *They are just a glorified probe yet cost much more.*
* **Sensor array build cost** `700 RU => 500 RU`
* **Sensor array build time** `70s => 60s`
* **Sensor array primary sensor range** `13000 => 12000`

## Cloak Generators
> *Cloak generators are not used very often because of the long research time and the lack of modules.*
* **Cloak generator build cost** `800 RU => 750 RU` (To match HW2.)
* **Cloak generator research time** `50s => 30s`

## Platforms
* **Vaygr missile platform missile speed** `228 => 320`

## Hyperspace Gateways
> *Hyperspace gateways are too inconvenient to be worth the cost - they are almost never built in competitive games and for good reason.*
* **Gateway health** `18750 => 27750` (It is killed far too easily for its cost especially without the armor upgrade.)
* **Gateway link cost** `750 RU => 50 RU` (Its possible to change the gateway a gateway is linked to but its not worth it in most cases considering the cost.)
* **Gateway build cost** `325 RU => 450 RU` (This is to transfer part of the cost of linking a gateway to the gateway build cost.)
* **Gateway vision range** `1000 => 4000` (This is the minimum range the unit can see - e.g any unit, even ones in a dust cloud, will be visible at this range.)
* **Gateway sensor range** `4000 => 7500` (This is the maximum range the unit can see.)
* **Gateway heal time** `1200s => 600s`
* **Gateway move speed** `800 => 1200`
* **Gateway nebula damage** `40s => 120s` (This is the time it takes to die in a nebula.)
* **All probes can now travel through a gateway** (Platforms are able to travel through a gateway even though they are single shot units.)

## Destroyers
> *Destroyers feel a bit clumsy and there isn't much point in rushing them over frigates.*
* **Vaygr destroyer missile speed** `228 => 320` (So that the missiles can catch a collector.)
* **Vaygr destroyer research cost** `2000 RU => 1750 RU` (To counteract the more expensive capital ship facility.)
* **HW1 destroyer turn speed** `9 => 15`
* **HW2 destroyer turn speed** `9 => 18` (This is much needed because of how HW2 destroyers need to face their bow to the enemy.)
* **Destroyer acceleration time** `6s => 3s`
* **Destroyer turn acceleration time* `0.5s => 0.4s`
* **Destroyer turn brake time* `0.3s => 0.2s`
* **Destroyer damage to capitals** `+25%` (They take a very long time to kill carriers and each other.)

## Vaygr Capitals
> *Vaygr usually uses HMF because going capitals costs a huge amount for them. These changes are designed to both
   make getting fast carriers more expensive and to make destroyers more viable in 1v1s.*
* **Vaygr capital facility build cost** `1250 RU => 1500 RU` (To bring the cost closer to Hiigarans and nerf fast carriers.)
* **Vaygr health upgrade cost** `3500 RU => 3000 RU`
* **Vaygr health upgrade time** `95s => 90s`
* **Vaygr speed upgrade cost** `1750 RU => 1500 RU`
* **Vaygr speed upgrade time** `80s => 70s`
* **Vaygr battlecruiser research cost** `2500 RU => 3000 RU` (The cost of upgrades have been redistributed onto battlecruisers.)
* **Shipyard build cost** `4000 RU => 3750 RU` (To counteract the increased capital ship facility cost.)
* **Shipyard build time** `85s => 80s` (To make double DD more viable.)

## Hiigaran Research
> *Becuase the advanced research module is sold, its cost in the end is mainly a temporary hurdle so the cost can be safely reduced.*
* **Hiigaran advanced research module cost** `2250 RU => 1750 RU` (This is to give Hiigarans more RUs to spend in the mid game.)

## Improved Manufacturing
> *Hiigaran carrier improved manufacturing is arguably less useful than Vaygr improved manufacturing since Vaygr tends to have more carriers - Vice versa for capitals.*
* **Hiigaran carrier improved manufacturing cost** `2250 RU => 2000 RU`
* **Vaygr carrier improved manufacturing cost** `2250 RU => 2500 RU`
* **Vaygr flagship improved manufacturing cost** `1500 RU => 1250 RU`
* **Vaygr shipyard improved manufacturing cost** `1750 RU => 1500 RU`

## Healing
> *Healing slows units down a substantial amount.*
* **Speed reduction under healing** `65% => 95%` (Meaning units will only be 5% slower when being healed.)

## Tactical Icons
* **Sensor arrays are a wide probe**
* **Anti-capital fighters are a right facing triangle**
* **Anti-corvette fighters are a down facing triangle**
* **Miscellaneous fighters are an up facing triangle**
* **Anti-capital platforms are a rotated hexagon**
* **Hyperspace gateways are a pentagon**
