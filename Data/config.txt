[h1]Dual Command Mode[/h1]

In multiplayer you will often end up with an odd number of players which means you either need to add AI, fight in uneven teams or FFA all of which are not always what you would like. 

Dual command mode allows one player to control two players worth of units. You will start with two motherships, 2 carriers, double the usual starting RUs and Unit cap is also double what it usually is. Research cost is also doubled to ensure you pay the full price for two players worth of units.

To Enable:
- Change your race to a 2X version of the race
- Add a CPU and put it in the slot you would like to have as your second main
- Enable the Dual Command option
- Set the Dual Command Player Slot to the slot of the player who will dual command
- Set the Dual Command Slave Slot to the slot of the CPU you just added

Notes:
- The CPU's units will be given to you at the start of the game so make sure it is the same race as you (2X or not)
If they are not the same race you will not be able to build from their production
